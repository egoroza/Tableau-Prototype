# Issue Tracking Prototype
The Tableau Prototype is a prototype created for my summer internship in the summer of 2017. The prototype uses ReactJS and Bulma to construct a cutting-edge and clean cut prototype for a data management application. The prototype includes different views for tracking different customer/client issues, with changeable views based on user permissions.
